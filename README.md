# Hello-World
my first repository in Git hub . It will expand :-)
I would love to do more with this forum in coming weeks.
I am a software engineer who loves coding.
I was a designer for legacy applications. 
I have a passion for newer technlogies.
This is a whole new world for me. I wish to adapt to this enviroment as soon as I could.
